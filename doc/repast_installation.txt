These installation instructions are for terminal users. 
Commands listed in this document can be normally performed in a terminal on Linux and mac systems. 
In case of difficulties with the command line interface, or any other problem, please contact the developers.  

A Java Development Kit has to be installed on your system. 
Please follow the instructions on repast web site
https://repast.github.io
to gather information on how to setup your system properly to run repast. 

Once the right JDK is in your system, you have to download all the packages which make up the repast symphony library. 

This can be easily done by following the instruction on the website. However, this implies the installation of eclipse.

The alternative way of using repast proposed in this document avoids the use of eclipse, so that we need to download only the repast java packages.

This can be done from the Repast website
https://repast.github.io

In particular we have to find out the url of the repast update site.
Normally, the url is written in the download section.

At the time of writing the update site url is:
https://repocafe.cels.anl.gov/repos/repast

The latest version of repast in in the plugin folder you can find at the update site url 
(look for this folder among the many ones listed. As you can see, several folders contains previous version of repast)

You can download all the jars by using the wget command (you have to install it if not included in your system) with the recursion option -r.

To install repast, make the following steps.

Suppose, for example, your home directory is /home/computer. 
Create a temporary directory:
mkdir repast_packages
then move to this directory:
cd repast_packages
and download the files from the Repast update site:

wget -r -l1 --no-parent -nd --no-check-certificate https://repocafe.cels.anl.gov/repos/repast/plugins/

Some minutes are needed to complete the download.

Create a new directory where to install the repast. In your home directory type
mkdir repast
this creates the repast directory, but feel free to name this folder at your convenience.

Move all the jar files from the temporary directory repast_packages to the repast folder

mv repast_packaes/*.jar repast

Now, we have to extract all the jars in the repast folder. Enter the repast folder
cd repast
type the following command

ls *.jar|awk -F'.jar' '{print "unzip "$0" -d "$1}'|sh

Now you can remove all the jar files in the repast folder and you can remove the temporary directory.

The result is a series of directory inside the \verb+repast+ directory.

Test your installation typing

java -cp "/home/computer/repast/repast.simphony.runtime_<version>/lib/*:/home/computer/repast/repast.simphony.runtime_<version>/bin" repast.simphony.runtime.RepastMain

where you have to replace \verb+<version>+ with the version identification number (for example \verb+2.3.0+).

After a while, the repast window should pop up.
