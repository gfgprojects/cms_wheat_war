Please, if Repast is not installed in your machine,  perform the operation described in the repast_installation.txt before this file.

We assume the cms_wheat code is in in your system. Therefore, you have the following directory tree:
cms_wheat
  doc
  run
  rs_model

Move your terminal present working directory in the cms_wheat/run folder.

By performing the following instruction you should be able to run the model and replicate the article results.

===========================
edit the paths.txt file
the file has four lines
1) the path to the repast packages folder (without final)
2) the repast version
3) the path to the cms_wheat model folder (without final /) 
4) the path to the other libraries (the folder have to contain the jts and geotools folders)
5) blank line

example:

/home/giulioni/abm_java_libraries/repast
2.7.0
/home/giulioni/tmp/wheat_fore/codice/02/cms_wheat
/home/giulioni/abm_java_libraries

Once you have provided this information, make the configure file executable and run it.

The configure script creates three file:
compile
run_batch
run_gui

=====================
compile by typing
./compile 

=====================
Generate output for the neutral phase

copy the file
cms_wheat_losers_winners_whole/rs_model/cms_wheat/data/data_2013_neutral/producers_fao_1993_2016.csv
in
cms_wheat_losers_winners_whole/rs_model/cms_wheat/data/producers_w.csv
(and also in producers.csv)

and 

cms_wheat_losers_winners_whole/rs_model/cms_wheat/data/data_2013_neutral/buyers_Misc_tuned_1993_2016.csv
in
cms_wheat_losers_winners_whole/rs_model/cms_wheat/data/buyers_Misc.csv

Note that all the demand components are summed in the buyers_Misc.csv file.  
Therefore, the buyers_Food.csv, buyers_Feed.csv and buyers_Seed.csv files has all zeros.

with run as your current directory
run the model by typing
./run_batch

when the simulation ends
create the run/output/output_neutral folder an
move the run/output/z* files generated by the run in run/output/output_neutral

=====================
generate output for El Nino 

copy the file
cms_wheat_losers_winners_whole/rs_model/cms_wheat/data/data_2013_nino/producers_fao_1993_2016_2013_nino.csv
in
cms_wheat_losers_winners_whole/rs_model/cms_wheat/data/producers_w.csv
(and also in producers.csv)

and 

cms_wheat_losers_winners_whole/rs_model/cms_wheat/data/data_2013_nino/buyers_Misc_tuned_1993_2016_2013_nino.csv
in
cms_wheat_losers_winners_whole/rs_model/cms_wheat/data/buyers_Misc.csv

run the simulation with the run_batch

move the run/output/z* files in run/output/output_nino

=====================
generate output for La nina 

Procede similarly to the previous step

=====================

Now the three output subfolders have z* output files relating to three different simulations

=====================
now we execute the R script r_fitness_function_evaluation.R 
to evaluate the simulation goodness of fit

Having scripts as your working directory 

execute the R script r_fitness_function_evaluation.R

this will display a chart with normalized US wheat prices and normalized prices from the simulation (neutral case).

They should be very close to each other.

=====================

Obtain the price and quantities percentage deviations

Using R with scripts as working directory, 
execute the r_cost_comparison.R script (it uses several other R scripts and other csv files included in the scripts directory)

At the end of the execution you will find the following files in the scripts directory

change_import_nina2013.csv
change_import_nino2013.csv
change_price_nina2013.csv
change_price_nino2013.csv

=====================
Making the figure with metapost

Enter the run/scripts/metapost_figure folder

Execute the r_write_input_for_metapost.R R script

it generates a number of mpinput files

exit R and type the following command at the command line:

mptopdf fig_effects_2013.mp

This will generate the figure in pdf format.
The filename of this figure is
fig_effects_2013-1.pdf

This is the table included in the article.
